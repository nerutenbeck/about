### About

I'm a data scientist with two years experience recruiting, training, and leading a team in model and pipeline development and ten years experience building and deploying statistical and machine learning models in a production environment. 

I'm passionate about translating business objectives into data analytics pipelines and incorporating data analytics into business strategy.

My technical focus is on Bayesian learning, combining deep learning and Bayesian learning, and uncertainty and risk quantification.

My industry background is carbon offsets and forest ecology and management, but I'm interested in positions across a wide range of fields related to green technology, energy, ESG finance, climate change mitigation, environmental management, and AI ethics.
